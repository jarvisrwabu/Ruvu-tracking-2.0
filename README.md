# Ruvu river tracking

The Ruvu river Tracking App is a mobile application designed for the purpose of managing the
water resources in the Ruvu River in Tanzania. The app provides users with information about
the boundaries limited to use the water resources as well as the ability to report any issues or
incidents that may lead to a drastic drop in amount of water in the river, which could lead to
scarcity of water to the areas dependent on it mainly Pwani and Dar es Salaam.
